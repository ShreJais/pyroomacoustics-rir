## Room Impulse Response (RIR) Similarity Calculator

This repo documents my final project for EE 522 (Immersive Audio Signal Processing) in Spring 2020 taken by Prof. Chris Kyriakakis.

**What is RIR?**

Room impulse response characterizes the behaviour of a room for a particular source and location of microphone/subject. Given a desired frequency response, it is of potential interest to find a room which ‘sounds similar,’ i.e. modifies the source in a similar way.

Rooms differ in properties such as shape and size, which determine their surface area and volume, and also in the materials they contain, which determines its overall ‘absorptivity.’ It is an interesting problem to determine if rooms of different shape, size, and absorption can sound similar to each other as well.

**Objectives**

1. Create a dataset of realistic rooms with varying size, shape, and absorption coefficient
2. Calculate and store the impulse response in time and frequency domain for the dataset
3. Given a different room, recommend the three most similar rooms from the dataset
4. Analyze the variation of the frequency response with room size and absorption coefficient
